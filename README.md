# 17Maths
This is a one-of-kind maths solution webapp.
I converted a paint app into a maths solving app.
This app recognizes handwritten maths equations written on a maths canvas, solves the equation and returns the result.
I had two versions of the app: one(this one) that uses a python backend to solve, and the other which uses Anthropic API to solve the equations written on the canvas. I choose to upload that which uses python on here because that was the initial idea.
